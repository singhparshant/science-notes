<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Decentralised finance (DeFi) has emerged as a potential substitute for traditional financial institutions, offering peer-to-peer transactions and a diverse range of services that democratise finance by enabling users to participate in protocol governance. However, several studies have suggested that the current governance mechanisms require improvements. This article provides an overview of findings associated with DeFi governance.</p>

<h3>Centralisation of Governance in DeFi Protocols<a class="headerlink" href="#centralisation-of-governance-in-defi-protocols" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Lending Protocols</strong></p>
<p>Lending Protocols are DeFi applications built on top of blockchain technology that allow users to lend and borrow cryptocurrency assets without the need for intermediaries such as banks or traditional financial institutions.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Decentralized Exchanges</strong></p>
<p>Decentralized Exchanges (DeXs) are peer-to-peer trading platforms built on top of a blockchain that enable the direct exchange of cryptocurrency assets without the need for a central authority or intermediary.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Yield Aggregator</strong></p>
<p>Yield Aggregator are DeFi applications that automate the process of seeking out the best yield opportunities for cryptocurrency assets, and provide users with a way to optimize their returns on investment.</p>
</aside>
<p>Centralisation in DeFi has become a growing concern among researchers with several studies identifying a significant level of centrality in the governance mechanisms of DeFi protocol. Barbereau et al., <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id31" title="Tom Barbereau, Reilly Smethurst, Orestis Papageorgiou, Alexander Rieger, and Gilbert Fridgen. Defi, not so decentralized: the measured distribution of voting rights.

The bond voting mechanism issues ‘voting bonds’ to voters, which essentially requires a commitment to stake an amount of tokens, for a time period to gain voting power. Therefore, by combining this time commitment with weighed voting with a time commitment, sybil attacks are more difficult. Quadratic voting, another solution to voting concentration, allows participants to convey both their preferences and the intensity of those preferences, however, the drawback of this mechanism is its vulnerability to sybil attacks, voter collusion and voter fraud <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id36" title="Aggelos Kiayias and Philip Lazos.

<h3>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The vision of DeFi is to foster a democratic process of governance and sustain high levels of decentralisation. However, recent studies have highlighted significant centrality in DeFi governance mechanisms, indicating the need for improvements in the existing governance models. The studies analysed in this article have revealed that the majority of the voting power in several protocols is concentrated among the top token holders, with evidence of increasing centralisation over time. Moreover, DeFi has been found to face challenges in the voting and governance process. In view of some of these challenges, researchers have proposed novel solutions such as a bond voting and an AI-enabled parameter-selection solution to improve the current mechanisms. Given the importance of decentralisation in the underlying philosophy of DeFi, proposing more solutions to governance challenges is crucial for creating a more inclusive and democratic financial ecosystem. Therefore, continued research and development will certainly be required.</p>

<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>According to World Bank estimates, nearly 850 million people lack an official identity <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id58" title="CLAIRE CASHER JULIA CLARK, ANNA DIOFASI. 850 million people globally don’t have id—why this matters and what we can do about it.

This has led to a rise in digital transactions and the need for a secure and reliable identity management system. SSI is emerging as a decentralised alternative to traditional centralised identity management systems, in which identities are cryptographically verifiable. It allows individuals to control their digital identities and share them with trusted parties. Each entity in the SSI system is identified by a unique DID (Decentralised Identifier) as shown below, which can be resolved to reveal information such as the entity’s public key and other metadata.</p>

<h3>Rationale Behind Mobile Theft Prevention using Blockchain<a class="headerlink" href="#rationale-behind-mobile-theft-prevention-using-blockchain" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Mobile theft has become a growing concern for individuals and organizations around the world. In addition to the financial loss associated with the theft, there is also a significant risk of personal data being compromised. The use of blockchain technology for mobile theft prevention offers a secure and efficient solution for preventing mobile theft <span id="id4">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id19" title="Andreas Göbel. Using blockchain to prevent mobile phone theft. Camelot, 2018. URL: https://blog.camelot-group.com/2018/12/using-blockchain-to-prevent-mobile-phone-theft/.">Gob18</a>]</span>. This technology can help individuals and organizations protect their mobile devices and personal information by providing a decentralized and tamper-proof way to track and block stolen mobile devices. By using private blockchains, the proposed model can be implemented in a way that ensures security and privacy, while also reducing the risk of fraud or malicious activity.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Decentralized and tamper-proof:</strong> Blockchain technology enables a decentralized and tamper-proof system for tracking and disabling stolen mobile devices. This ensures that the information stored on the blockchain is accurate and cannot be tampered with, making it a reliable source for tracking stolen devices <span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id20" title="Chirag. Blockchain: the technology revolutionizing mobile app security. Appinventive, 2023. URL: https://appinventiv.com/blog/blockchain-technology-revolutionizing-mobile-app-security/.">Chi23</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure and private:</strong> The proposed model uses a private blockchain network that connects the mobile manufacturing companies and their nodes <span id="id6">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id21" title="Gwyneth Iredale. The rise of private blockchain technologies. 101 Blockchains, 2021. URL: https://101blockchains.com/private-blockchain/.">Ire21</a>]</span>. This helps to ensure the security of the network and the data stored in it, and also helps to maintain the privacy of the users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automation of process:</strong> Smart contracts can be programmed to automatically disable the device once the signal is sent, reducing human error and increasing the efficiency <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id22" title="Utpal Biswas Debashis Das, Sourav Banerjee.

<h3>Alternative Technologies Available under Development<a class="headerlink" href="#alternative-technologies-available-under-development" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>IMEI blocking:</strong> One of the most common methods for preventing mobile theft is to block the IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number of a stolen device. This can be done by reporting the theft to the mobile carrier, who will then blacklist the IMEI number and prevent the device from connecting to the network <span id="id10">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id25" title="Jacob Hicks.

</ul>
<p>In comparison, the model of using blockchain for mobile theft prevention offers several potential advantages over these existing methods. A decentralized and tamper-proof system for tracking and disabling stolen devices, and the smart contract can be programmed to automatically disable the device once the signal is sent, reducing human error and increasing the efficiency. Additionally, the proposed model can potentially work in cross-border cases, which is not possible with IMEI and SIM card blocking, and also can be integrated with other theft prevention methods.</p>
</section>
<section id="methodology">
<h3>Methodology<a class="headerlink" href="#methodology" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The smart contract enables the registration of new mobile devices and maps them to their respective phone numbers. This allows users to update the status of their mobile devices on the blockchain, indicating whether they are lost or stolen. The smart contract also allows for changes to be made to the registered mobile devices’ information, such as their International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, and to update the corresponding phone number. In this way, the smart contract provides a secure and tamper-proof solution for tracking the status of mobile devices on the blockchain.</p>
<p>The mobile application is designed to constantly monitor the state of the mobile device by making API calls to the blockchain. If the blockchain indicates that the device has been reported stolen, the application takes action by disabling the device’s Wi-Fi and network connections and forcing it into airplane mode. By doing so, the application prevents the thief from using any of the phone’s features, rendering it useless until it can be recovered by the rightful owner.</p>
<p>When a mobile phone is marked as stolen on the blockchain through the smart contract and later found, the owner can connect it to a computer via USB and use USB mode to provide data to the phone. This allows the owner to activate the phone again by providing the data through the USB based hotspot.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/yathin017/ec50576dcd706e5868f4d96edcd5a00c">smart contract</a> is written in both Solidity and JavaScript programming languages that can be deployed on a blockchain network. It is designed to prevent mobile theft by using a mapping function to keep track of mobile devices using their IMEI numbers and phone numbers.</p>
<p>The smart contract consists of six functions that can be called by authorized users.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">addIMEI()</span></code>  allows users to add their mobile devices to the blockchain by passing in their IMEI and phone numbers. The function first checks if the IMEI and phone numbers already exist on the blockchain, and if not, it adds the device to the mapping function.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">activateLost()</span></code>  is used to activate the lost mode of a mobile device. The function checks if the IMEI number of the device exists on the blockchain and if it does, it sets the value of  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isIMEIlost</span></code> to true, indicating that the device is lost.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">deactivateLost()</span></code> is used to deactivate the lost mode of a mobile device. The function checks if the IMEI number of the device exists on the blockchain and if it does, it sets the value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isIMEIlost</span></code> to false, indicating that the device is no longer lost.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">changeIMEI()</span></code> allows users to change the IMEI number of their device. The function checks if the old IMEI and phone number exists on the blockchain and if it does, it replaces the old IMEI with the new one.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">changePhoneNumber()</span></code> allows users to change the phone number associated with their device. The function checks if the old IMEI and phone number exists on the blockchain and if it does, it replaces the old phone number with the new one.</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">checkIMEI()</span></code> is a view function that allows anyone to check if a particular device is lost by passing in the IMEI number of the device. The function returns true if the device is lost, and false if it is not.</p></li>

<p class="admonition-title">Key Insights</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sharding is a promising scaling technique for blockchains, dividing the network into smaller partitions called shards to process transactions in parallel, thus increasing throughput.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharding approaches in blockchain systems vary, with solutions like Ethereum 2.0 using multiple shard chains coordinated by a beacon chain, and others, such as Near Protocol’s Nightshade, opting for processing data chunks in a single blockchain with different validator sets.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharding implementation faces challenges in security, cross-shard communication, and data availability. These require solutions like random validator assignment, transaction receipts, and erasure coding.</p></li>
<li><p>While sharding offers potential scalability improvements, layer 2 solutions like ZK-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups remain the preferred short-term scaling methods until sharding proves its ability to handle high transaction volumes.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>As the adoption of blockchain technology increases, scalability remains the central challenge and a major obstacle for blockchain to be adopted by mainstream industries. Bitcoin can only process 7 transactions per second (TPS), while the Ethereum blockchain can only process 15 TPS. Although after the Merge of Ethereum 1.0 into Ethereum 2.0, the TPS of Ethereum 2.0 is expected to reach 100,000 TPS, gas fees remain a major issue. Ethereum has been relying on ZK-rollups to scale the network, but rollups are only a short-term solution because of interoperability issues with other blockchains since they are mainly Ethereum-focussed. Therefore, the blockchain community is actively looking for a solution to the scalability problem.</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>ZK-Rollups</strong></p>
<p>ZK-Rollups in Ethereum are a Layer 2 scaling solution that uses zero-knowledge proofs to bundle multiple transactions into a single proof on the main chain. This reduces on-chain data storage and gas costs while maintaining security. As a result, ZK-Rollups enable higher throughput, lower fees, and faster confirmations for Ethereum transactions while preserving privacy and decentralization.</p>

<h3>What is Sharding?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-sharding" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Sharding, originally a database design principle, is now being considered a promising solution to overcome the scalability challenges of blockchain systems. This scaling technique divides the blockchain network into smaller partitions called shards, each responsible for processing a subset of transactions. This allows the blockchain to process more transactions in parallel, thereby increasing the throughput of the system.</p>
<p>There are 2 common techniques blockchains implement to improve throughput:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Delegate all the computation to a small set of powerful nodes; (e.g., Algorand, Solana)</p></li>
<li><p>Each node in the network only does a subset of the total work (Sharding). Ethereum, <a class="reference external" href="https://near.org/">Near</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://hedera.com/">Hedera</a> use this technique.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p><strong>Sharding in Blockchains vs Traditional Databases</strong></p>
<p>The sharding techniques used in traditional databases cannot be directly applied to blockchains because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Blockchains rely on Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols which have been shown to be a scalability bottleneck.</p></li>
<li><p>Distributed databases depend on highly available transaction coordinators for atomicity and isolation assurance; however, blockchain coordinators could exhibit malicious behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>In a distributed database, any node can belong to any shard, but a blockchain must assign nodes to shards in a secure manner to ensure that no shard can be compromised by the attacker.</p></li>

<h4>Sharding in Ethereum<a class="headerlink" href="#sharding-in-ethereum" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>In Ethereum, data is distributed among several “shard chains” ([<a class="reference internal" href="#sharding-eth-near"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 4</span></a>]). Each of these shard chains submits a record of transactions to the “beacon chain” or “coordinating layer”, which coordinates and manages the shards by maintaining synchronization and ensuring a common ledger. The shards receive sets of transactions from the mempool. Under the Ethereum 2.0 proposal, these TX are split based on their transaction types: Token transfers and Smart contract interactions. Validators then use an EVM to process shards’ data into a block and update the Merkle tree’s state on the beacon chain <span id="id7">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id67" title="Alexander Kudzin, Kentaroh Toyoda, Satoshi Takayama, and Atsushi Ishigame.

<section id="sharding-in-near-blockchain">
<h4>Sharding in Near Blockchain<a class="headerlink" href="#sharding-in-near-blockchain" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>Near’s sharding technique is called “Nightshade” <span id="id8">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id65" title="Near. Near nightshade whitepaper. Near, 2020. URL: https://near.org/papers/nightshade/.">Nea20a</a>]</span>. Although the full implementation is still in progress, the idea is that instead of having multiple subchains with a single beacon chain, the data is divided into smaller partitions called chunks. Each chunk is processed by a different set of validators. The validators are randomly assigned to chunks, and the assignment is done in a way that the same validator is not assigned to multiple chunks, as shown in [<a class="reference internal" href="#sharding-eth-near"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 4</span></a>]. At present, the Near blockchain has 4 shards, and the eventual plan is to have 100 shards {cite}`near roadmap.</p>

<h3>Sharding Challenges<a class="headerlink" href="#sharding-challenges" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>The main issue with sharding is that it is extremely complicated to implement, as it opens up possibilities of new attack vectors and security challenges. The following are some of the challenges that need to be addressed before sharding can be implemented in a blockchain system.</p>
<section id="security">
<h4>Security<a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>In a 10-shard system, each shard’s security is reduced by a factor of 10 due to separate validator sets. Upon hard-forking a non-sharded chain with X validators into a sharded chain, each shard has X/10 validators. Consequently, compromising one shard necessitates corrupting only 5.1% (51% / 10) of the total validators. This is a significant reduction in security. To overcome this challenge, Ethereum uses a beacon chain to randomly assign validators to shards. Blockchains like Near and Algorand use Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) to assign validators to shards. This ensures that the validators are randomly assigned to shards and the same validator is not assigned to multiple shards.</p>
<p>Hafid et al. <span id="id9">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id70" title="Abdelatif Hafid, Abdelhakim Senhaji Hafid, and Mustapha Samih. A tractable probabilistic approach to analyze sybil attacks in sharding-based blockchain protocols. IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, 2022.">HHS22</a>]</span> propose a Probabilistic Generating Function Analysis (PGFA) approach as an effective and tractable method to analyze the security of sharding-based blockchain protocols. They conclude that an increase in the number of Sybil IDs (unique nodes), network size, and ID Selection Pool (random pool from which nodes are randomly selected to be assigned to shards) size results in a higher failure probability, compromises network security and can lead to shard takeover attacks.</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">

<p>Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs) are cryptographic primitive that allows a user to generate a random number that can be verified by anyone.</p>

</section>
<section id="cross-shard-communication">
<h4>Cross-Shard Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-shard-communication" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>As the network gets divided into multiple shards, it is important to ensure that the shards can communicate with each other to maintain consistency and interoperability. As seen in [<a class="reference internal" href="#cross-sharding"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 5</span></a>], this can be problematic if there is forking within the shards and the block issuing the transaction is not included in the canonical chain. Both Near and Ethereum overcome this challenge by exchanging receipts between the shards. The receipts are used to prove that a transaction has been executed on a shard <span id="id10">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id68" title="Near. Near runtime spec. Near, 2020. URL: https://nomicon.io/RuntimeSpec/Receipts.">Nea20b</a>]</span> and the corresponding transaction can be executed on the other shard. In Hedera Hashgraph, which uses a gossip protocol to exchange information between shards, each shard maintains a queue of outgoing messages for other shards. Messages are sent from one shard to another through nodes randomly contacting each other, along with proof of consensus. The process continues until the receiving shard confirms message processing with an updated sequence number in its shared state <span id="id11">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id69" title="Hedera. Hedera hashgraph whitepaper. Hedera, 2020. URL: https://hedera.com/hh_whitepaper_v2.1-20200815.pdf.">Hed20</a>]</span>. Instead of receipts, Hedera uses sequence numbers which are maintained by a shard for each other shard as a proof of latest execution message.</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Sequence Numbers</strong></p>
<p>In the context of Hedera’s multi-shard system, sequence numbers are 64-bit identifiers assigned to inter-shard messages to keep track of their order. When a transaction involves resources from different shards, it triggers inter-shard messages. Each shard maintains a queue of outgoing messages to be sent to other shards, and each message within a specific queue is assigned a unique sequence number.</p>

<section id="data-availability">
<h4>Data Availability<a class="headerlink" href="#data-availability" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The data availability problem relates to the difficulty of ensuring that all necessary data for verifying a block’s validity is accessible to all participants in the network. For instance, a light client cannot access complete block data and thus cannot
verify the validity of data. To overcome this problem, erasure coding is used. If the light client can retrieve a sufficient number of chunks of data, it can reconstruct the original data and verify the block’s validity. Ethereum and Near are currently using this approach.</p>
<aside class="margin sidebar">
<p class="sidebar-title"><strong>Erasure Codes</strong></p>
<p>Erasure codes allow a piece of data M chunks long to be expanded into a piece of data N chunks (“chunks” can be of arbitrary size), such that any M of the N chunks can be used to recover the original data.</p>

<h3>Sharding in Hedera<a class="headerlink" href="#sharding-in-hedera" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>As per Hedera network’s whitepaper <span id="id12">[<a class="reference internal" href="#id69" title="Hedera. Hedera hashgraph whitepaper. Hedera, 2020. URL: https://hedera.com/hh_whitepaper_v2.1-20200815.pdf.">Hed20</a>]</span>, it starts as a single shard composed of nodes managed by Governing Council Members. As the council grows, the network will transition to a multi-shard system to enhance performance, enable parallel consensus, and maintain asynchronous Byzantine fault tolerance. Nodes will be randomly assigned to shards by a master shard, balancing hbar distribution and minimizing centralization risks. Shards will trust and collaborate, allowing seamless cross-shard transactions. Nodes will communicate via push messages, maintaining queues for inter-shard messaging. Transactions involving multiple shards will be consistently recorded in each shard’s state, ensuring ledger-wide coherence and integrity. The master shard will be responsible for maintaining the overall state of the network, including the hbar supply and the hbar distribution across shards.</p>

<h3>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Sharding is the most promising solution to overcome the scalability challenges of blockchain systems. However, although Ethereum and Near have made significant progress in implementing sharding, it is still not time-tested and it remains to be seen whether these blockchains will be able to bear a load of transactions volume when scenarios such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2020/08/31/defi-the-hot-new-crypto-trend-of-2020/?sh=5576a8a05bce">DeFi boom</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://qz.com/1145833/cryptokitties-is-causing-ethereum-network-congestion">NFT craze</a> happen again. Until then, layer 2 solutions such as ZK-Rollups and Optimistic Rollups will continue to be the preferred scaling solutions for blockchain systems.</p>
